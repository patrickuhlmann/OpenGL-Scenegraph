Name of Nodes
=============
Every Node should have a unique name. We ensure this with a static set of Names in the Node Base Class. Whenever you create a node it will check if there is already a node with the same name

States in Nodes
===============
We don't want to add the State in the Composite or Node class because not all of the Nodes actually need the state.
